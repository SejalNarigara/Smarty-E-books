    <p>1. Father kissed us and said, "Good-bye, dears. Be good
    children, and help mother as much as you can. The year will
    soon pass away. What a merry time we will have when I come back
    again!"</p>

    <p>2. Father kissed mother, and then stepped into the train.
    The guard blew his whistle, and the train began to move. We
    waved good-bye until it was out of sight.</p>

    <p>3. Then we all began to cry&mdash;even Tom, who thinks
    himself such a man. It was <i>so</i> lonely without father.</p>

    <p>4. Tom was the first to dry his eyes. He turned to me and
    said, "Stop that crying. You are the eldest, and you ought to
    know better."</p>

    <p>5. He made mother take his arm, just as father used to do.
    Then he began to whistle, to show that he did not care a bit.
    All the way home he tried to make jokes.</p>

    <p>6. As soon as we had taken off our coats and hats, Tom
    called us into the sitting-room. "Look here," he said: "we're
    going to have no glum faces in this house. We must be bright
    and cheerful, or mother will fret. You know father wouldn't
    like that."</p>

    <div class="figure2l">
        <img src="illustrations/Fig01-2ed.png"
             width="400"
             height="281"
             alt="">
    </div>

    <p>7. We said that we would do our best. So off we went to help
    mother to make the beds and to dust the rooms. While we were
    doing this we quite forgot to be sad.</p>

    <p>8. After tea we went into father's room and looked at the
    globe. "I'm going to follow father right round the world," said
    Tom. "Please show me which way he is going." Mother did so.</p>

    <p>9. "By this time next week," she said, "we shall have the
    first of many long letters from father. I am sure we shall
    enjoy reading them. He will tell us about the far-off lands
    which he is going to see."</p>

    <p>10. "That will be grand," I said. "I hope he will tell us
    <i>lots</i> about the children. I want to know what they look
    like, what they wear, and what games they play."</p>

    <p>11. Tom said he would rather not hear about children. He
    wanted to hear about savages and tigers and shipwrecks, and
    things like that.</p>

    <div class="figure2r">

             height="416"
             alt="">
    </div>

    <p>12. A week later the postman brought us father's first
    letter. How eager we were to hear it! Mother had to read it for
    us two or three times.</p>

    <p>13. Every week for many weeks the postman brought us letters
    from father. When he handed us a letter he used to say, "I'm
    glad to see that your daddy is all right so far."</p>

    <p>14. This book is made up of father's letters from abroad. I
    hope you will enjoy them as much as we did.</p><a name=

    <h2><a href="#L2">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;A LETTER FROM FRANCE.</a></h2>

    <p>1. MY DEAR CHILDREN,&mdash;I am writing this letter in a
    large seaport of the south of France. To-morrow I shall go on
    board the big ship which is to take me to
          Egypt.</p><a name="c2p2"></a>

    <p class="pic1">2. Let me tell you about my travels so far. The
    train in which I left our town took me to London. Next day
    another train took me to a small town on the
    seashore.</p><a name="Photo02-1"></a>

    <div class="figure1"
         style="width: 640px;">
        <img src="illustrations/Photo02-1.jpg"

        <p class="caption">The White Cliffs of Dover.<br>
         (<i>From the picture by J.M.W. Turner, R.A.</i>)</p>
    </div>

    <p>3. About twenty miles of sea lie between this town and
    France. At once I went on board the small steamer which was to
    take me across. The sea was smooth and the sun was shining.</p>

    <p>4. I stood on the deck looking at the white cliffs of dear
    old England. When I could see them no longer I found that we
    were not far from France.</p>

    <p>5. In about an hour we reached a French town which in olden
    days belonged to us. The steamer sailed right up to the railway
    station.</p>

    <p>6. I had something to eat, and then took my place in the
    train. Soon we were speeding towards Paris, the chief town of
    France.</p>

    <p>7. I looked out of the window most of the time. We ran
    through many meadows and cornfields. Here and there I saw rows
    of poplar trees between the fields.</p>

    <p>8. Now and then we crossed rivers with barges on them. On
    and on we went, past farmhouses and little villages, each with
    its church. The French villages look brighter than ours. I
    think this is because the houses are painted in gay
    colours.</p>

    <div class="figure2r">
        <img src="illustrations/Fig02-1ed.png"
             width="400"
             height="277"
             alt="">
    </div>

    <p>9. I saw many men, women, and children working in the
    fields. All of them wore wooden shoes. Most of the men and boys
    were dressed in blue blouses.</p>

    <p>10. There was a little French boy in my carriage. He wore a
    black blouse with a belt. His stockings were short, and did not
    come up to his knickerbockers. He was rather pale, and his legs
    were very thin.</p>

    <p>11. The boy was about Tom's age. He sat still, and held his
    father's hand all the way. I don't think Tom would have done
    this; he thinks himself too much of a man.</p>

    <p>12. After a time we crossed a broad river, and came to the
    dull, dark station of a large city. As we left it, I saw the
    tall spire of one of the grandest churches in all the
    world.</p>

    <p>13. On we went, past farms and villages and small towns,
    until at last we reached Paris.</p><a name="c3"></a>

        </div>
    </center><br clear="all">

    <p>1. Paris is a very grand and beautiful city. The French
    people say that France is a great garden. They also say that
    the finest flowers in this garden make up the nosegay which we
    call Paris.</p>

    <p>2. A great river runs through Paris. All day long you can
    see little steamboats darting to and fro on the river, like
    swallows. Near to the river are some beautiful gardens.</p>

    <div class="figure2r">
        <img src="illustrations/Fig03-1ed.png"
             width="450"
             height="256"
             alt="">
    </div>

    <p>3. I sat in these gardens, at a little table under the
    trees. As I sat there a man walked up the path. At once I heard
    a great chirping and a flutter of wings.</p>

    <p>4. All the birds in the garden flocked to him. They seemed
    to know him as an old friend. Some perched on his shoulders and
    some on his hat. One bold little fellow tried to get into his
    pocket. It was a pretty sight to see him feeding the birds.</p>

    <div class="figure2l">
        <img src="illustrations/Fig03-2ed.png"
             width="250"
             height="358"
             alt="">
    </div>

    <p>5. In the gardens there were many nurses carrying babies.
    These nurses were very gay indeed. They wore gray cloaks and
    white caps, with broad silk ribbons hanging down their
    backs.</p>

    <p>6. Some of the older children were playing ball, but they
    did not play very well. Until a few years ago French boys had
    few outdoor games. Now they are learning to play tennis and
    football.</p>

    <p>7. French boys are always clean and neatly dressed, however
    poor they may be. They think more about lessons than our boys
    do. Their school hours are much longer than ours.</p>

    <p>8. French girls have not so much freedom as our girls. A
    grown-up person takes them to school and brings them home
    again. Their mothers do not allow them to go for walks by
    themselves. I wonder how Kate and May would like this.</p>

    <p>9. Some day I must take you to see Paris. You would love to
    ramble through its streets. Many of them are planted with
    trees. Under these trees you may see men and women sitting at
    little tables. They eat and drink while a band plays merry
    tunes.</p>

    <div class="figure2r">
        <img src="illustrations/Fig03-3ed.png"
             width="275"
             height="239"
             alt="">
    </div>

    <p>10. You would be sure to notice that the French people have
    very good manners. When a Frenchman enters or leaves a shop he
    raises his hat and bows. A Frenchman is always polite, and he
    always tries to please you.</p>

    <p>11. I cannot now write anything more about Paris. I should
    like to tell you about its beautiful buildings and its fine
    shops, but I have no more time to spare.</p>

    <p>12. I hope you are all doing your best to make mother happy.
    I am very well; I hope you are well too.&mdash;Your loving
    FATHER.</p><a name="c4"></a>

    <h2><a href="#L4">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;ON THE WAY TO EGYPT.</a></h2>

    <p>1. MY DEAR CHILDREN,&mdash;I am writing this letter on board
    the big ship which is taking me to Egypt. Let me tell you what
    I have seen and done since I left Paris.</p>

    <p>2. It is a long day's ride from Paris to the seaport from
    which my ship set sail. Let me tell you about the journey. A
    few hours after leaving Paris the train began to run through
    vineyards.</p>

    <p class="pic1">3. At this time of the year a vineyard is a
    pretty sight. The broad leaves of the vine are tinted with
    crimson and gold. Beneath them are the purple or golden
    grapes.</p><a name="Photo04-1"></a>

    <div class="figure1"
         style="width: 640px;">
        <img src="illustrations/Photo04-1.jpg"
             width="600"
             height="384"
             alt=""><br>


        <p class="caption">THE GRAPE HARVEST.<br>
         (<i>From the picture by P.M. Dupuy in the Salon of 1909.
        Bought by the State.</i>)</p>
    </div>

    <p>4. As I passed through France the grapes were ripe, and were
    being gathered. I could see women and children going up and
    down between the rows of vines. They plucked the ripe fruit and
    put it into baskets. When the baskets were filled they were
    emptied into a big tub.</p>

    <p>5. When the tub was filled it was taken to a building near
    at hand. In this building there is a press which squeezes the
    juice out of the grapes. The grape juice is then made into
    wine.</p>

    <p>6. As evening drew on we came to a large town where two big
    rivers meet. It is a busy town, and has many smoky chimneys.
    Much silk and velvet are made in this town.</p>

    <p>7. I think you know that silk is made by the silkworm. This
    worm feeds on the leaves of the mulberry tree. In the south of
    France there are thousands of mulberry trees. There are also
    many orange and olive trees.</p>

    <p>8. The weather is much warmer in the south of France than it
    is in England. In the early spring all sorts of pretty flowers
    are grown on the hillsides. They are sent to England, and are
    sold in the shops when our gardens are bare.</p>

    <p class="pic">9. Now I must hurry on. For some hours we ran by
    the side of a swift river; with mountains on both sides of us.
    Then we reached the big seaport, and there I found my ship
    waiting for me.</p><a name="Photo04-2"></a>

    <p>10. It is a huge ship, with hundreds of cabins, a large
    dining-room, drawing-room and smoking-room. It is really a
    floating hotel.</p>

    <p>11. Most of the people on board are going to India. All day
    long they sit in chairs on the deck reading. Some of us play
    games, and at night we have dances and concerts.</p>

    <p>12. We have now been four days at sea. To-morrow we shall
    reach a town by the side of a great canal. This town and canal
    are in Egypt.</p>

        Guildhall Gallery. By permission of the Corporation of
        London.</i>)</p>
    </div>

    <p>1. MY DEAR CHILDREN,&mdash;With this letter I am sending you
    a beautiful picture. Look at it carefully, and you will see
    what Egypt is like.</p>

    <p>2. The water which you see in the picture is part of the
    great river Nile. If there were no Nile to water the land,
    Egypt would be nothing but a desert.</p>

    <p>3. Once a year, as a rule, the Nile rises and overflows its
    banks. The waters spread out over the country and cover it with
    rich mud. In this mud much cotton, sugar, grain, and rice are
    grown.</p>

    <p>4. Egypt now belongs to the British. They have turned part
    of the Nile into a huge lake, in which the water is stored.</p>

    <p>5. The water is let out of the lake when it is needed. It
    runs into canals, and then into drains, which cross the fields
    and water them.</p>

    <p>6. A sail along the Nile is very pleasant. There are lovely
    tints of green on the water. As the boat glides on, many
    villages are passed. Each of these has its snow-white
    temple.</p>

    <p class="pic">7. All along the river bank there are palm
    trees. They wave their crowns of green leaves high in the air.
    The fields are gay with colour. Above all is the bright blue
    sky.</p><a name="Photo05-2"></a>

        <p class="caption">The Chief City of Egypt.<br>
         (<i>From the picture by Talbot Kelly, R.I.</i>)</p>
    </div>

    <p>8. Look at the picture again. At a short distance from the
    water you see a village. It has a wall round it, and outside
    the wall is a ditch. In October the ditch is full of water; in
    spring it is dry.</p>

    <p>9. In and near this ditch the children and the dogs of the
    villages play together. You can see two boys in the picture.
    One of them is standing by his mother. The other boy is riding
    on a buffalo.</p>

    <p>10. In the middle of the village there is an open space.
    Sometimes this space is covered with bright green grass. Round
    it are rows of palm trees. The house of the chief stands on one
    side of this green.</p>

    <p>11. Every village has its well, and every well has its
    water-wheel for drawing up the water. By the side of the well
    the old men of the village sit smoking and chatting. The women
    come to the well to fill their pitchers with water.</p>

    <p class="pic">12. All the houses are built of Nile mud. This
    mud is dug out of the banks of the river. It is mixed with a
    little chopped straw to hold it together. Then it is put into
    moulds. After a time it is turned out of the moulds, and is
    left to dry in the sun.</p><a name="c6"></a>
    <hr class="chapter">

    <h2><a href="#L6">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;CHILDREN OF EGYPT.</a></h2>

    <p>1. In the picture you see two of the women of Egypt. One of
    them is standing at the edge of the river. She is filling her
    pitcher with water. The other woman is carrying a lamb in her
    arms.</p>

    <div class="figure2r">
        <img src="illustrations/Fig06-1ed.png"
             width="200"
             height="428"
             alt="">
    </div>

    <p>2. The people of Egypt have changed but little since the
    days of Moses. The men have brown faces, white teeth, and
    bright black eyes. Most of them wear beards and shave their
    heads.</p>

    <p>3. The women wear long dark cloaks. If they are well-to-do
    they cover their faces with a veil. They think it wrong to let
    their faces be seen by any men except their husbands.</p>

    <p>4. I think Kate would like to hear something about the
    children. Those who have rich fathers wear beautiful clothes,
    and have a very happy time. Poor children wear few clothes, and
    are nearly always covered with dust.</p>

    <p>5. Many of the boys go to school, and are taught just as you
    are. They read the same kind of books that you read.</p>

    <p>6. The children of Egypt always obey their parents, and are
    never rude to them. I think they have very good manners.</p>

    <p>7. All the people of Egypt love singing. Their voices are
    soft and sweet. The boatmen on the Nile sing as they row. The
    fruit-sellers sing as they cry their wares in the streets.</p>

    <p>8. Many of the boys in the chief city of Egypt are donkey
    drivers. In Egypt donkeys are far more used for riding than
    horses. The donkeys are beautiful little animals, and they trot
    along very quickly.</p>

    <p>9. Each donkey has a boy to run after it with a stick, and
    to shout at it to make it go. The donkey boys are very jolly
    little fellows. They always smile, however far they have to
    run.</p>

    <div class="figure2l">
        <img src="illustrations/Fig06-2ed.png"
             width="350"
             height="327"
             alt="">
    </div>

    <p>10. Most donkey boys wear a white or blue gown, and have a
    red cap, or fez, on the head. If a donkey boy sees an
    Englishman coming, he runs to him and says, "My donkey is
    called John Bull." If he sees an American coming, he says that
    his donkey's name is Yankee Doodle.</p>

    <p>11. Sometimes the donkey boy will ask the rider,&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Very good donkey?"</p>

    <p>If the rider says "Yes," he will then ask,&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Very good donkey boy?"</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>12. "Very good saddle too?"</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>"<i>Then me have very good present!</i>"</p>

    <p>13. Now let me tell you something that will surprise you.
    The people of Egypt in the old, old days thought that their
    cats were gods.</p>

    <p class="pic">14. They prayed to them and built temples to
    them. When the family cat died, all the people in the house
    shaved their eyebrows to show how sorry they were.&mdash;Best
    love to you all. FATHER.</p><a name="c7"></a>

    <h2><a href="#L7">7.&nbsp;&nbsp;THROUGH THE CANAL.</a></h2>

    <p>1. MY DEAR CHILDREN,&mdash;I have just sailed through a very
    wonderful canal. It joins two great seas together, and is now
    part of the way to India.</p>

    <p>2. By means of this canal we can sail from England to India
    in three weeks. Before it was made the voyage took three months
    or more.</p>

    <p>3. The canal was made more than forty years ago by a
    Frenchman. He dug a great ditch, and joined together a number
    of lakes. By doing so he made a waterway from sea to sea. This
    waterway is about a hundred miles long.</p>

    <p>4. I joined my ship at the town which stands at the north
    end of the canal. There is nothing to see in the town except
    the lighthouse and the shops. On the sea wall there is a statue
    of the Frenchman who made the canal.</p>

    <div class="figure2r">
        <img src="illustrations/Fig07-1ed.png"
             width="375"
             height="466"
             alt="">
    </div>

    <p>5. As we lay off the town we could see many little boats
    darting to and fro. The boatmen were dressed in all the colours
    of the rainbow&mdash;red, blue, green, and orange. In one boat
    there were men and women playing and singing songs.</p>

    <p>6. By the side of our ship men were swimming in the water. I
    threw a piece of silver into the water. One of the men dived,
    and caught it before it reached the bottom.</p>

    <p>7. On the other side of the ship there were great barges
    full of coal. Hundreds of men and women carried this coal to
    the ship in little baskets upon their heads. They walked up and
    down a plank, and all the time they made an awful noise which
    they called singing.</p>

    <p>8. When all the coal was on board, the ship began to steam
    slowly along the narrow canal. No ship is allowed to sail more
    than four miles an hour, lest the "wash" should break down the
    banks.</p>

    <p>9. Soon we passed out of the narrow canal into one of the
    lakes. Our road was marked by buoys. Away to right and to left
    of us stretched the sandy desert.</p>

    <p>10. In the afternoon we passed a station, where I saw a
    number of camels laden with boxes of goods. They were going to
    travel across the sands for many days.</p>

    <p>11. The sun went down in a sky of purple and gold. Then a
    large electric light shone forth from our bows. It threw a
    broad band of white light on the water and on the banks of the
    canal. Where the light touched the sands it seemed to turn them
    into silver.</p>

    <p class="pic">12. In less than twenty-four hours we reached
    the town at the south end of the canal. A boat came out from
    the shore, and this letter is going back with it.&mdash;Love to
    you all. FATHER.</p><a name="c8"></a>

    <h2><a href="#L8">8.&nbsp;&nbsp;AMONGST THE
    ARABS.&mdash;I.</a></h2>

    <div class="figure2l">
        <img src="illustrations/Fig08-1ed.png"

             height="421"
             alt="">
    </div>

    <p>1. MY DEAR CHILDREN,&mdash;I am now sailing along the Red
    Sea. The weather is very hot. All over the ship electric fans
    are hard at work. In spite of them I cannot keep cool.</p>

    <p>2. Away on the left, or port, side of the ship I see high
    hills. They are red in colour, and seem to be baked by the hot
    sun. Even through my spy-glass I cannot see a speck of green on
    them. All is red and bare.</p>

    <p>3. Beyond the hills lies the land of Arabia. It is a hot,
    dry land, in which years sometimes pass without a shower of
    rain. There is hardly ever a cloud in the sky, and there is no
    dew at night.</p>

    <p>4. Much of the land is covered with sand. Little or nothing
    will grow. You know that we call a sandy waste of this kind a
    <i>desert</i>.</p>

    <p>5. Here and there in the desert a few springs are found. The
    water of these springs causes grass and trees to grow well.
    Around each spring is what looks like an island of green in the
    midst of a red sea of sand. A green spot in a desert is called
    an <i>oasis</i>.</p>

    <p>6. The Arabs live upon these green spots. Some of them dwell
    in villages, and some wander from oasis to oasis. Those who
    live in villages build their houses of sun-dried bricks; those
    who wander from place to place live in tents.</p>

    <p>7. The Arabs are fine, fierce-looking men. They own flocks
    of sheep, herds of goats, camels and horses.</p>

    <div class="figure2r">
        <img src="illustrations/Fig08-2ed.png"
             width="450"
             height="319"
             alt="">
    </div>

    <p>8. An Arab's tent is woven out of camel's hair. So are the
    ropes of the tent. The poles are made of palm wood.</p>

    <p>9. Inside the tent there are leather buckets for drawing
    water. There are also skin bags for carrying it across the
    desert. There are no chairs or tables or beds in the tents. The
    Arabs squat upon the ground and sleep on rugs.</p>

    <p>10. In front of an Arab tent you are almost sure to see a
    woman grinding corn between two large stones. There is a hole
    in the top stone, and into this she pours the grain.</p>

    <p>11. She turns the top stone round and round, and the grain
    is ground into flour, which oozes out at the edges. With this
    flour she makes cakes.</p><br clear="all">

    <p>1. Date palms grow on every oasis. The date palm is a
    beautiful tree. It is very tall, and has a crown of leaves at
    the top.</p>

    <p>2. The fruit grows in great golden clusters. Sometimes a
    cluster of dates weighs twenty-five pounds.</p>

    <p>3. The date palm is beloved by the Arabs, because it is so
    useful to them. They eat or sell the dates, and they use the
    wood for their tents or houses. From the sap they make wine.
    Out of the leaf-stalks they weave baskets.</p>

    <p>4. Some of the Arabs are traders. They carry their goods
    from oasis to oasis on the backs of camels. A large number of
    laden camels form a caravan.</p>

    <p>5. A camel is not pretty to look at, but the Arab could not
    do without it. I think you can easily understand why the camel
    is called the "ship of the desert." It carries its master or
    its load across the sea of sand from one green island to
    another.</p>

    <p>6. The hoofs of the camel are broad, and this prevents them
    from sinking into the sand. The camel can go for a long time
    without food or water.</p>

    <p class="pic">7. The camel is very useful to the Arab, both
    when it is alive and when it is dead. It gives him milk to
    drink, and its hair is useful for making clothes, tents, and
    ropes.</p>

         (<i>From the picture by J.F. Lewis, R.A., in the South
        Kensington Museum.</i>)</p>
    </div>

    <p>8. I think I told you that when I was sailing along the
    canal I saw a caravan. It was then beginning to cross the
    desert. Very likely, weeks or months will pass away before its
    journey comes to an end.</p>

    <p>9. There are no roads across the desert, so it is very easy
    for a caravan to lose its way. Then the men and camels wander
    on until all their food and water are finished. At last they
    fall to the ground, and die of hunger and thirst.</p>

    <p>10. Dreadful sand-storms often arise. The storm beats down
    upon the caravan, and sometimes chokes both men and camels. A
    journey across the desert is full of dangers.</p>

    <p>11. Before I close this letter, let me tell you a little
    story. One day an Arab belonging to a caravan overslept himself
    at an oasis. When he awoke, the caravan had started on its
    journey again, and was many miles away.</p>

    <p>12. The Arab followed the caravan, in the hope of catching
    it up. On and on he walked, but nothing could he see of it.
    Then darkness came on, and he lay on the sand and slept until
    morning.</p>

    <p>13. When the sun rose he began his journey again. Hours
    passed, but still there was no sign of the caravan. At last he
    was quite overcome by hunger and thirst. He fell to the ground,
    and was too weak to rise again.</p>

    <div class="figure2r">
        <img src="illustrations/Fig09-2ed.png"
             width="300"
             height="275"
             alt="">
    </div>

    <p>14. Looking around, he saw something black lying on the
    sand, not far away. He crawled to it, and found that it was a
    small bag which had fallen from the back of a camel.</p>

    <p>15. The poor Arab was filled with joy. He hoped that the bag
    would contain food of some sort. With trembling fingers he tore
    it open. Alas! it was full of gold and jewels.</p>

    <p>16. "Woe is me!" cried the poor fellow; "had it been dates
    my life would have been saved."</p>

    <p class="pic">17. This little story shows you that on the
    desert dates may sometimes be worth much more than gold and
    jewels. I hope you are well and happy.&mdash;Your loving

    <p>1. MY DEAR CHILDREN,&mdash;Hurrah! I am on shore again,
    after nine long days at sea. Yesterday I reached Bombay, the
    chief seaport of India.</p>

    <p>2. Soon after I landed a friend came to see me at my hotel.
    He drove me round Bombay, and showed me all the sights. I wish
    you had been with me to see them.</p>

    <p>3. Here in Bombay I seem to be in a new world altogether. It
    is a world of wonderful light and colour. The bright hot sun
    floods the streets and dazzles my eyes. Everywhere I see bright
    colour&mdash;in the sky, the trees, the flowers, and the
    dresses of the people.</p>

    <p>4. The streets are always full of people. They are dark
    brown in colour; their hair is black, their eyes are bright,
    and their teeth are as white as pearls. Most of the people are
    bare-legged and bare-footed.</p>

    <p>5. The men wear white clothes, with turbans and sashes of
    yellow, green, or blue. Yesterday was a feast-day. In the
    morning I saw thousands of the people bathing in the sea.
    Afterwards they roamed about the streets in their best clothes.
    One crowd that I saw looked like a great tulip garden in full
    bloom.</p>

    <p>6. The women wear a garment of red, blue, or some other
    bright colour. This garment covers them from the neck to the
    knee. Almost every woman wears rings of silver on her arms and
    ankles. Some of them have great rings in their noses, as well
    as rings in their ears and on their toes.</p>

    <p>7. You would be amused to see the people carrying their
    burdens on their heads. Yesterday I saw a dozen men carrying a
    grand piano on their heads.</p>

    <div class="figure2r">
        <img src="illustrations/Fig10-2ed.png"
             width="175"
             height="423"
             alt="">
    </div>

    <p>8. From childhood the women carry jars of water or baskets
    of earth in this way. They hold themselves very upright and
    walk like queens.</p>

    <p>9. Bombay is a very busy city. The streets are thronged with
    carriages, motor cars, bullock carts, and electric trams. As
    the people walk in the middle of the road, it is not easy for a
    carriage to make its way through the streets.</p>

    <p>10. The drivers ring bells, or shout to warn the people:
    "Hi, you woman with the baby on your hip, get out of the
    way!&mdash;Hi, you man with the box on your head, get out of
    the way!"</p>

    <p>11. I think you would like to see the bullock carts. They
    are very small, and are drawn by two bullocks with humps on
    their shoulders. The driver sits on the shaft and steers them
    with a stick. These carts carry cotton to the mills or to the
    docks.</p>

    <div class="figure2l">

             alt="">
    </div>

    <p>12. In some of the carriages and motor cars you may see rich
    men wearing fine silk robes. Many of these rich men now dress
    as we do, except that they wear turbans instead of
    hats.</p><a name="c11"></a>
    <hr class="chapter">

    <h2><a href="#L11">11.&nbsp;&nbsp;IN THE STREETS.</a></h2>

    <p>1. I should like you to see the shops of Bombay. Most of
    them are quite unlike our British shops. They have no doors and
    no windows, but are open to the street.</p>

    <p>2. Our shopkeepers try to make a fine show of their goods.
    The Indian shopkeeper does nothing of the sort. He simply piles
    his goods round his shop and squats in the midst of them. There
    he sits waiting for people to come and buy.</p>

    <div class="figure2l">
        <img src="illustrations/Fig11-1ed.png"
             width="375"
             height="475"
             alt="">
    </div>

    <p>3. In our shops there is a fixed price for the goods. In
    India nothing has a fixed price. You must bargain with the
    shopkeeper if you wish to buy anything. Very likely he will ask
    you three times the price which he hopes to get.</p>

    <p>4. Our penny is divided into four parts; each of these parts
    is called a farthing. The Indian penny is divided into twelve
    parts; each of these parts is called a "pie." An Indian boy or
    girl can buy rice or sweets with one pie.</p>

    <p>5. There are thousands of beggars in India. They go to and
    fro in front of the shops begging. The shopkeepers are very
    kind to them, and never send them away without a present.</p>

    <p>6. Very good order is kept in the streets. At every street
    corner stands a native policeman, dressed in blue, with a flat
    yellow cap on his head and a club by his side. Some of the
    policemen ride horses, and carry guns and lances.</p>

    <p>7. The parks of Bombay are large open spaces covered with
    grass. Round them are rows of palm trees. In these parks you
    may see men and boys playing all sorts of games.</p>

    <p>8. Indians are very fond of cricket, which they play very
    well. Not many years ago an Indian prince was one of the best
    players in England.</p>

    <p>9. Polo is also played in the parks of Bombay. It is an
    Indian game, but Britons now play it too. Polo is just hockey
    on horseback.</p>

    <p>10. The players ride ponies which are very quick and nimble.
    Each player carries a mallet with a very long handle. With this
    mallet he strikes a wooden ball and tries to drive it between
    the goal posts.</p>

    <p>11. Last night I stopped to watch some Indian boys playing
    marbles. When Tom plays the game, he places the marble between
    his thumb and forefinger and shoots it out with his thumb.</p>

    <p>12. The Indian boy does not shoot the marble in this way at
    all. He presses back the second finger of one hand with the
    forefinger of the other. Then he lets go and strikes the marble
    with the finger that was bent back. Some of the boys are very
    clever at this game.</p>

    <p class="pic">13. Bombay has some very fine buildings. On the
    top of most of them you see the Union Jack, the flag of
    Britain. Not only Bombay but all India belongs to Britain. I
    hope you are all well.&mdash;Best love.

    <h2><a href="#L12">12.&nbsp;&nbsp;OUR INDIAN COUSIN.</a></h2>

    <p>1. MY DEAR CHILDREN,&mdash;I am now in the north of India,
    not far from the great river Ganges. It is a long railway
    journey from Bombay to this place. I have been in the train two
    days and two nights.</p>

    <p>2. I am now beginning to understand what a vast land India
    is. Do you know that it would make sixteen lands as large as
    our own? One in every five of all the people on earth lives in
    India.</p>

    <p>3. Perhaps you can guess why I have made this long journey
    from Bombay. My brother, your uncle, is the chief man in this
    part of the country. He and I have been parted for many years.
    I am now living in his house.</p>

    <div class="figure2l">
        <img src="illustrations/Fig12-1ed.png"
             width="450"
             height="285"
             alt="">
    </div>

    <p>4. Let me tell you about little Hugh, your cousin. He was
    born in India seven years ago, and he has never been to
    England. He hopes to come "home" to see you all in a few
    months' time.</p>

    <p>5. Hugh's home is a big house, all on the ground floor. It
    has no upstairs. The rooms are very large and lofty. This is
    because the weather is very hot for the greater part of the
    year. If the rooms were not large and high, they would be too
    hot to live in.</p>

    <p>6. In every room there is a beam of wood with a short
    curtain hanging from it. This is the punkah. The beam is hung
    from the roof by ropes. In the hot weather a boy sits outside
    and pulls the punkah to and fro with a rope. In this way he
    makes a little breeze, which keeps the room cool.</p>

    <p>7. The roof of the house juts out all round and is held up
    by pillars. We sit outside, under the roof, whenever we can.
    During the heat of the day we must stay indoors.</p>

    <p>8. The garden round the house is very large. There are many
    tall palm trees in it. Some of the other trees bear most
    beautiful blossoms of crimson, yellow, and blue. All along the
    front of the house are many flowerpots, in which roses and
    other English flowers are growing.</p>

    <p>9. A few days ago little Hugh came to me and asked if he
    might show me what he called "the compound." I said "Yes." So
    he took my hand and led me away.</p>

    <div class="figure2r">
        <img src="illustrations/Fig12-2ed.png"
             width="325"
             height="316"
             alt="">
    </div>

    <p>10. First he showed me the gardener. He is a short, dark
    man, and he squats down to do his work. He is a very good
    gardener, and he is proud of his flowers. Every morning he
    comes to the house with a flower for Hugh's father and mother
    and uncle.</p>

    <p>11. Next, Hugh took me to see the well. It is behind the
    house. The mouth of the well is on the top of a mound. To reach
    it you must walk up a sloping road. Above the mouth of the well
    there is a wheel.</p>

    <p class="pic">12. A rope runs over this wheel. At one end of
    the rope there is a large leather bag. The other end of the
    rope is fastened to the necks of a pair of
          bullocks.</p><a name="c13"></a>
    <hr class="chapter">

    <h2><a href="#L13">13.&nbsp;&nbsp;IN THE GARDEN.</a></h2>

    <p>1. The bullocks walk backwards up the sloping road. This
    lowers the leather bag into the well, where it is filled with
    water. Then the bullocks walk down the sloping road. This pulls
    the bag up to the mouth of the well.</p>

    <div class="figure2r">
        <img src="illustrations/Fig13-1ed.png"
             width="375"
             height="477"
             alt="">
    </div>

    <p>2. A man empties the water out of the bag into a tank by the
    side of the well. The water runs out of this tank into the
    garden, where it spreads out into many little streams. It is
    this water which makes the trees, the plants, and the grass
    grow so well in the garden.</p>

    <p>3. If the garden were not watered in this way, it would soon
    be brown and bare. For many months at a time no rain falls in
    India. Then dust a foot deep lies on the roads, and the ground
    cracks with the heat.</p>

    <p>4. When the dry season is over the rain begins to fall. It
    comes down in torrents for days together. In some places more
    rain falls in a single day than we have in a whole year.</p>

    <p>5. During the "rains" the rivers become full to the brim,
    and the whole land is fresh and green. Sometimes the "rains" do
    not come at all. Then the crops wither away, and the people
    starve.</p>

    <p>6. In our country we are never sure of the weather. It
    changes so often that we talk about it a great deal. In India
    nobody talks about the weather. During seven months of the year
    every day is fine.</p>

    <p>7. In our country we almost always have plenty of water for
    our crops, and for drinking and washing. Plenty of fresh water
    is a great blessing to a land. In many parts of India water is
    very scarce.</p>

    <p>8. I told you that the great river Ganges is not far away
    from little Hugh's home. This grand river begins in the
    mountains of North India. I wish you could see these mountains.
    They are the highest on earth. They rise up from the plains
    like a huge wall, and their tops are always covered with fields
    of ice and snow.</p>

    <p>9. These ice-fields slowly move down the mountain sides.
    Then they melt, and this gives rise to the Ganges and to the
    other great rivers of North India.</p>

    <p>10. Millions of the Indian people love the Ganges, and they
    have good reason to do so. It gives water and food to more than
    twice as many people as dwell in the British
    Islands.</p><a name="Fig13-2"></a>

    <div class="figure2l">
        <img src="illustrations/Fig13-2ed.png"
             width="550"
             height="481"
             alt="">
    </div>

    <p>11. Many Indians think that every drop of water in the river
    is holy. They believe that if they bathe in its waters their
    souls will be washed clean from sin.</p>

    <p>12. There is a town by the side of the Ganges which the
    Indians say is the holiest place on earth. It is full of
    temples. Millions of Indians visit these temples every
    year.</p>

    <p>13. All along the river bank there are stone steps leading
    down to the water. Standing in the stream are men and women and
    children who have come from all parts of India. They wash
    themselves in the stream, and pour the holy water over their
    heads as they pray.</p>

    <p>14. People who are very ill are carried to this place, that
    they may die by the side of "Mother Ganges." They die happy if
    they can see her or hear the sound of her waters during their
    last moments.</p>

    <p>15. When they die their bodies are taken to the steps. There
    they are washed in the river water, and are placed on piles of
    wood. Friends set fire to the wood, and soon the bodies are
    burnt to ashes. These ashes are thrown into the stream, which
    bears them to the distant ocean.</p><a name="c14"></a>

    <h2><a href="#L14">14.&nbsp;&nbsp;INDIAN BOYS AND
    GIRLS.</a></h2>

    <p>1. I am very fond of going about the streets with your
    uncle. The Indian children always amuse me.</p>

    <p>2. When Indians grow up they are rather grave and sad. The
    children, however, are always bright and merry. Indian fathers
    and mothers are very fond of their boys. They care very little
    for their girls.</p>

    <p>3. Boys soon become men in India. They begin work at an
    early age, and they are married when they are about sixteen.
    Girls are married a few years younger.</p>

    <p>4. Almost every boy follows the trade of his father. A
    farmer's son becomes a farmer, a weaver's son becomes a weaver,
    and so on.</p>

    <p>5. Many of the boys go to school, but not many of the girls.
    They, poor things, begin to work in the house or in the field
    almost as soon as they can walk. Much of the hard rough work in
    India is done by poor women and girls.</p>

    <p>6. A rich father keeps his girls shut up in the back part of
    his house. Their faces are never seen by any man except those
    of their own family. If they go out of the house, they cover
    themselves from head to foot with a thick veil. Sometimes they
    are carried from place to place in a closely shut box on
    poles.</p>

    <p>7. Are you not sorry for these poor rich girls? I am. They
    can never play merry games with boy friends, or go for long
    walks in the country.</p>

    <p>8. They know nothing of the beautiful world in which they
    live. Their rooms are fine, their dresses are grand, and their
    jewels are lovely; but they are only poor prisoners after
    all.</p>

             alt="">
    </div>

    <p>9. Yesterday I went with your uncle to see a village school.
    There were only twenty boys in it. The roof was off the
    schoolhouse, so the classes were held in the open air.</p>

    <p>10. The boys sat on forms, just as you do. The teacher wrote
    on a blackboard, and taught the children to do sums with a ball
    frame. Each boy had a reading-book. It was not printed in
    English, but in the tongue spoken in that part of the
    country.</p>

    <p>11. Some of the boys wrote in copy-books, but most of them
    wrote on thin boards, which they used instead of slates.
    Instead of a pencil they used a pen made of a reed.</p>

    <p>12. Chalk was ground up and wetted in a little cup. The boys
    dipped their reed pens into the cup, just as you dip your steel
    pen into the ink. The letters and figures which they wrote were
    very different from ours.</p>

    <p>13. Some of the boys read their books very well, and worked
    hard sums. They sang "God save the King" for me in their own
    tongue.</p>

    <p class="pic">14. In the towns there are large and good
    schools. Some of the scholars are very clever indeed. I think
    Indian boys are much fonder of their lessons than our
    boys.</p><a name="c15"></a>

        <p class="caption">AN INDIAN RAJAH.</p>
    </div>

    <p>1. In his last letter Tom asked me to tell him something
    about elephants and tigers. I will try to do so.</p>

    <p>2. Yesterday your uncle and I went out to shoot pigeons. An
    Indian chief, or rajah, lent us an elephant to carry us to the
    shooting ground.</p>

    <p>3. A driver sat on the neck of the huge animal. Instead of a
    whip he had a goad of sharp steel. I did not see him prick the
    elephant with this goad. He guided the animal with voice and
    hand.</p>

    <p>4. On the elephant's back there was a large pad upon which
    we were to sit. I could see no ladder, so I wondered how I was
    to climb up. Just then the elephant knelt down on his hind
    legs.</p>

    <p>5. Your uncle showed me how to get up. "Here," he said, "is
    a ladder of two steps. The first step is the elephant's foot,
    the second is the loop of his tail."</p>

    <p>6. He held the end of the elephant's tail in his hand and
    bent it to make a loop. When I put my foot on it he lifted the
    tail, and in this way helped me on to the elephant's back.</p>

    <p>7. When your uncle had climbed up, the elephant jogged off
    at a good pace. He went along rough, narrow paths, over ditches
    and the beds of streams. Never once did he make a false
    step.</p>

    <p>8. An elephant costs a great deal of money. Only princes and
    rich men can afford to keep them. Sometimes a great prince has
    as many as a hundred elephants in his stables.</p>

    <p>9. When a prince rides through a city in state his elephants
    wear rich cloths, which are studded with gems. Sometimes the
    elephants' heads are painted and their tusks are covered with
    gold.</p>

    <p>10. In the drawing-room of your uncle's house there is a
    beautiful tiger skin. The tiger that used to wear this skin was
    shot by your uncle about three years ago.</p>

    <div class="figure2l">
        <img src="illustrations/Fig15-1ed.png"
             width="350"
             height="172"
             alt="">
    </div>

    <p>11. It was a man-eating tiger&mdash;that is, an old tiger
    that could no longer run fast enough to catch deer. This
    man-eater used to hide near a village. He would creep up
    silently behind men and women, and stun them with a blow of his
    paw. Then he would drag them away and eat them.</p>

    <p>12. The people of the village came to your uncle and begged
    him to kill the man-eater. He agreed to do so. Near to the
    tiger's drinking-place a little hut was built in a tree. One
    night your uncle sat in this hut with his gun on his knee,
    waiting for the tiger to come.</p>

    <p>13. Slowly the hours went by, and your uncle felt sure that
    the tiger had gone to another place to drink. Just as he was
    thinking of going home to bed the huge animal crept into the
    moonlight.</p>

    <div class="figure2r">
        <img src="illustrations/Fig15-2ed.png"
             width="375"
             height="490"
             alt="">
    </div>

    <p>14. Nearer and nearer he came. Then your uncle lifted his
    gun, took a steady aim, and shot the tiger through the
    heart.</p>

    <p>15. In the morning there was great joy among the people of
    the village because their fierce foe was dead. They hung
    garlands of flowers round your uncle's neck, and sang his
    praises in many songs.</p>

    <p>16. Now I must close this very long letter.&mdash;Best love
    to you all. FATHER.</p><br clear="all">

    <h2><a href="#L16">16.&nbsp;&nbsp;A LETTER FROM
    BURMA.&mdash;I.</a></h2>

    <p>1. MY DEAR CHILDREN,&mdash;Since I last wrote to you I have
    visited several of the large cities of India. A week ago I was
    in the largest city of all.</p>

    <p>2. On Christmas morning I sailed down the mouth of the
    Ganges into the open sea, on my way to the country of
    Burma.</p>

    <p>3. Now I am in the chief town of Burma, and you will expect
    me to tell you something about the land and its people. From
    what I have seen, I think Burma is a prettier country than
    India.</p><a name="Fig16-1"></a>

    <div class="figure2l">
        <img src="illustrations/Fig16-1ed.png"
             width="175"
             height="391"
             alt="">
    </div>

    <p>4. In the chief town there seem to be people from many
    lands. I saw Chinamen, with their pigtails hanging down their
    backs. I also saw Indians from across the sea, and white men
    from our own country. Of course, there were also many Burmese,
    as the people of Burma are called.</p>

    <p>5. Kate and May will like to hear something about the
    Burmese girls and women. They are not at all sad like the
    Indians, but are very bright and gay. As I write these lines I
    see a party of Burmese girls passing my window, I can hear them
    laughing.</p>

    <p>6. They are very dainty in their dress. One girl wears a
    skirt of pink silk and a blouse of light green. She has
    bracelets on her arms, ear-rings in her ears, a string of coral
    round her neck, and flowers in her hair.</p>

    <p>7. In one hand she carries a bamboo sunshade; in the other
    she holds a big paper cigar! She is very fond of smoking, and
    you never see her without a cigar. On her feet she wears
    sandals.</p>

    <p>8. The men are gentle and rather lazy. The women have far
    more "go" in them than the men. Many of them keep shops, and
    are very good traders. The wife is the chief person in every
    home.</p>

    <div class="figure2r">
        <img src="illustrations/Fig16-2ed.png"
             width="200"
             height="467"
             alt="">
    </div>

    <p>9. The men also wear skirts, and sometimes their jackets are
    very gay. They wrap a handkerchief of pink, or of some other
    bright colour, round their head.</p>

    <p>10. The Burmese worship Buddha, a prince who lived more than
    two thousand years ago. He was a very noble man, and he gave up
    all the pleasant things of life that nothing might turn his
    thoughts from goodness.</p>

    <p>11. Amongst other things he taught men to be kind to
    animals. All animals are well treated in Burma.</p>

    <p>12. All over the land you see temples to Buddha. These
    temples grow narrower and narrower the higher they rise. They
    all end in a spire above which there is a kind of umbrella. It
    is made of metal, and all round its edge are silver or golden
    bells, which make pretty music as they are blown to and fro by
    the wind.</p>

    <p>13. By the side of many of these temples you may see a great
    image of Buddha. Most of the images are made of brass. The
    Burmese pray before these images, and offer flowers and candles
    and rice to them.</p><a name="Fig16-3"></a>

    <p>1. Wherever you go in Burma you see monks. They have shaven
    heads, and they wear yellow robes. Every morning they go out to
    beg. Boys in yellow robes go with them, and carry large bowls
    in their hands.</p>

    <p>2. The people come out of their houses and put food into the
    bowls. The monks do not thank them. They say that he who gives
    is more blessed than he who takes.</p>

    <p>3. The monks live in houses built of teak wood. In every
    village you can see a monk's house standing in a grove of palm
    trees. In these houses the monks keep school.</p>

    <p>4. Every Burmese boy lives for some time in one of the
    monks' houses. Here he learns to read and write, and is taught
    to be a good man.</p>

    <p>5. I went to see the most beautiful of all the monks'
    houses. It is in a city far up in the country. The building is
    of dark-brown teak wood, and has many roofs, one above the
    other. It is covered with carving, and here and there it is
    gilded.</p>

    <p>6. Many boys in yellow robes were playing beneath the trees.
    They were the scholars of the school. One of the boys told me
    that he was never going to leave the place. When he was old
    enough he meant to be a monk.</p>

    <p>7. In the city I saw the palace of the king from whom we
    took Burma. It stands inside a large space, with high walls all
    round it. Outside the wall is a broad ditch full of water. When
    I saw the ditch it was overgrown with water-plants covered with
    pink blossoms.</p>

    <p>8. Many buildings, something like the monks' houses, form
    the king's palace. Some of the buildings are very richly
    carved, and are covered with gold leaf. Inside one of them I
    saw great teak pillars, also covered with gold.</p>

    <p>9. The chief building ends in a very lofty spire, with a
    beautiful metal umbrella above it. The Burmese used to believe
    that this spire was in the very middle of the earth.</p>

    <div class="figure2l">

             height="378"
             alt="">
    </div>

    <p>10. Another fine building is a high lookout tower. From the
    top of it there is a grand view. On one side I saw a hill
    covered with temples. At the foot of the hill there were four
    hundred and fifty of these temples. There must be thousands of
    them in and near the city.</p>

    <p>11. As I drove to my hotel last night I saw a number of boys
    playing Burmese football. They do not take sides, nor do they
    try to kick goals. The football is made of basket-work.</p>

    <p>12. The boys stand round in a ring, and the game is to keep
    the ball from touching the ground. The boys pass the ball from
    one to the other by knocking it up with their heads, arms,
    hands, legs, or toes. Some of the boys are very clever at this
    game.</p>

    <p>13. Burma has many beautiful rivers and some fine mountains.
    By the side of the rivers much rice is grown. Away in the north
    there are grand forests filled with wild animals. Tigers are
    often shot within twenty miles of the old king's palace.</p>

    <p class="pic">14. Now I have filled my paper, and I must bring
    this letter to an end. I hope you are all well and happy. I am
    leaving Burma tomorrow.&mdash;Best love to you all.

    <p class="pic2">1. MY DEAR CHILDREN,&mdash;A week ago I landed
    in the beautiful island of Ceylon. It lies to the south of
    India. Get mother to show it to you on the globe.</p>

    <p>2. I am still under the British flag, the Union Jack. I can
    see it waving from the top of a big building. The people of
    Ceylon are proud to call themselves British.</p>

    <p>3. I have just been for a ride through the streets of the
    chief town. I rode in a rickshaw&mdash;that is, a kind of large
    baby-carriage drawn by a man. My rickshaw had rubber on its
    wheels, so we went along very smoothly and quickly.</p>

    <p>4. Some of the carts are drawn by little bullocks that trot
    along as fast as a pony. I often meet carts with a high cover
    of thatch. These carts carry the tea, which grows on the hills,
    down to the ships in the harbour.</p>

    <p>5. Some of the men of Ceylon wear tortoise-shell combs in
    their hair. They are very proud of these combs, and some of
    them are very handsome.</p>

    <p class="pic">6. The children of Ceylon seem very happy. They
    are pretty and clean, and always obey their parents. Many of
    them learn to speak and read English. They love dancing and
    singing, and they never quarrel.</p><a name="Photo18-1"></a>

        </div>
    </center>

    <p>7. By the next ship home I am sending mother a chest of tea.
    The tea grew on the hills of Ceylon. I made a journey to these
    hills by train. On the way we passed through thick forests, and
    by the side of beautiful rivers.</p>

    <p>8. Ceylon is very rich in plants and trees. The cocoanut
    palm grows almost everywhere. On one of the rivers I saw a raft
    of cocoanuts. A man swam behind it and pushed it along.</p>

    <p>9. With this letter I send you a picture of a tea-garden.
    Notice the men and women plucking the leaf. Many of them come
    from the south of India. Look at the white planter. He comes,
    as you know, from our own country.</p>

    <p>10. In the middle of Ceylon there are many high mountains.
    The highest is called Adam's Peak. It stands like a great wedge
    high above the other hills.</p>

    <p>11. The people of Ceylon believe that it is a holy mountain.
    They say that once upon a time Buddha climbed to the top of
    this mountain. To prove that he did so they show you his
    footprint. It is more than five feet long!</p>

    <p>12. A little temple has been built over the footprint. Men,
    women, and children climb the mountain, to lay little gifts
    before the footprint, and to strew sweet flowers about it. When
    this is done, the children kneel down and ask their parents to
    bless them.</p>

    <p>13. To-morrow I leave Ceylon on a long voyage to China. You
    will not hear from me for several weeks. I hope you are all
    well, and that you are still good children.&mdash;I remain,

         (<i>From the picture by T. Hodgson Liddell,
        R.B.A.</i>)</p>
    </div>

    <p>1. MY DEAR CHILDREN,&mdash;Three weeks have gone by since I
    last wrote to you. I have made my voyage safely, and I am now
    in a great city of China called Canton.</p>

    <p>2. Ask mother to show you China on the globe. You see at
    once that it is a vast country. It is larger than the whole of
    Europe. One-fourth of all the people in the world live in
    China.</p>

    <p>3. All round this city of Canton there is a high wall. From
    the wall the city seems to be a beautiful place. When, however,
    you enter it, you soon find that it is dirty and full of foul
    smells.</p><br clear="all">

    <div class="figure2r">
        <img src="illustrations/Fig19-1ed.png"
             width="400"
             height="413"
             alt="">
    </div>

    <p>4. The streets are very narrow, and are always crowded with
    people. Many of them are roofed in to keep them cool. Most of
    them are so narrow that no carriage can pass along them. People
    who wish to ride must be carried in a kind of box on the
    shoulders of two or more men.</p>

    <p>5. I am sure you would like to see the signboards that hang
    down in front of the shops. The strange letters on them are
    painted in gold and in bright colours. They look very gay
    indeed.</p>

    <p>6. The shops sell all sorts of things&mdash;silk, books,
    drugs, flowers, china, and birds. Some of the shops only sell
    gold and silver paper. The Chinese burn this paper at the
    graves of their friends. When they do this they think that they
    are sending money for their dead friends to spend in the other
    world.</p>

    <p>7. Many things are also sold in the streets. The street
    traders carry a bamboo pole across the shoulder. From the ends
    of this pole they sling the baskets in which they carry their
    wares. Many workmen ply their trades in the open street, and
    you are sure to see quack doctors, letter-writers, and
    money-changers.</p>

    <p>8. The Chinese do in the open street many things which we do
    inside our houses. A Chinaman likes to eat his meals where
    every one can see him.</p>

    <p>9. Sometimes he will sit in front of his house and wash his
    feet. Yesterday I saw a man having his tooth drawn out of
    doors. A crowd stood round him, watching to see how it was
    done.</p>

    <div class="figure2l">
        <img src="illustrations/Fig19-2ed.png"
             width="350"
             height="333"
             alt="">
    </div>

    <p>10. How should you like to go for a ride in a wheelbarrow?
    In China the wheelbarrow is often used for carrying people or
    goods from place to place. It has a large wheel in the middle.
    Round the wheel there is a platform for people or goods.</p>

    <p>11. A broad river runs through the city. It is crowded with
    boats, in which live many thousands of people. Many of these
    people never go ashore at all.</p>

    <p>12. Over the sterns of the boats there are long baskets.
    These are the backyards of the floating city. Hens, ducks,
    geese, and sometimes pigs, are kept in these baskets.</p>

    <div class="figure2r">
        <img src="illustrations/Fig19-3ed.png"
             width="350"
             height="358"
             alt="">
    </div>

    <p>13. The little boys who live on the boats have a log of wood
    fastened to their waists. This keeps them afloat if they fall
    overboard. The little girls have no such lifebelts. In China
    nobody troubles about the girls.</p>

    <p class="pic2">14. Nearly all the boats have an eye painted on
    their bows. Perhaps this seems strange to you. The Chinese,
    however, say,&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        "<i>S'pose no got eye, no can see;<br>
        S'pose no can see, no can walkee</i>"
    </blockquote><a name="c20"></a>
    <hr class="chapter">

    <h2><a href="#L20">20.&nbsp;&nbsp;CHINESE BOYS AND
    GIRLS.</a></h2>

    <p>1. Chinese fathers and mothers are very glad when their
    children are boys. In China the boys are much petted. Their
    mothers give way to them, and let them do as they please.</p>

    <p>2. Girls, however, are not welcome. Sometimes they are
    called "Not-wanted" or "Ought-to-have-been-a-boy."</p>

    <p>3. A Chinese boy has always two names, sometimes four. He
    has one name when he is a child, and another when he goes to
    school. He has a third name when he begins to earn money. When
    he dies he has a fourth name.</p>

    <p>4. Chinese boys are very fond of flying kites, which are
    shaped like fish or butterflies or dragons. Old gentlemen are
    just as fond of kite-flying as boys.</p>

    <p>5. In China you will often see boys playing hopscotch or
    spinning peg-tops. They also play shuttlecock, but they have no
    battledore. They kick the shuttlecock with the sides of their
    feet.</p>

    <p>6. Chinese boys love to set off fireworks, such as crackers,
    wheels, and rockets. If the fireworks make a loud noise, so
    much the better.</p>

    <div class="figure2r">
        <img src="illustrations/Fig20-1ed.png"
             width="375"
             height="391"
             alt="">
    </div>

    <p>7. Chinese children are taught to show very great respect to
    their parents. They all bow and kneel to their fathers and
    mothers. A boy who is not kind and good to his parents is
    thought to be a wicked wretch.</p>

    <p>8. A few days ago I went to see a Chinese school. The boys
    sit on stools at tiny tables. In front of them they have a
    stone slab, a stick of Chinese ink, and some brushes with which
    they write.</p>

    <p>9. There is always a great din in a Chinese schoolroom. The
    boys shout at the top of their voices. If they do not make a
    noise, the teacher thinks that they are not learning.</p>

    <p>10. When a boy knows his lesson he goes up to his master to
    say it. He turns his back to his master, and does not face him
    as you do.</p>

    <p>11. A Chinese boy becomes a man at sixteen years of age. He
    chooses his work in life when he is quite a baby. Let me tell
    you how he does it.</p>

    <p>12. When he is one year old he is seated in the middle of
    such things as money, books, and pens. Then the parents watch
    him to see what he will play with.</p>

    <p>13. If he takes up the money, they say that he must be a
    trader or a banker. If he takes up a book or a pen, they say
    that he must be a writer or a teacher or a
          scholar.</p><a name="c21"></a>

    <h2><a href="#L21">21.&nbsp;&nbsp;HAIR, FINGERS, AND
    TOES.</a></h2>

             alt="">
    </div>

    <p>1. Chinese men shave their heads, all but a small patch of
    hair. This is allowed to grow very long, and is plaited into a
    pigtail. I have seen Chinamen with coloured ribbons woven into
    their pigtails.</p>

    <p>2. When men are at work they twine their pigtails round
    their heads. When they wish to show respect to any person they
    let down their pigtails. A man who has a long, thick pigtail is
    very proud of it.</p>

    <p>3. Sometimes men who are sent to prison have their pigtails
    cut off. This is thought to be a great disgrace. When they
    leave prison they buy false pigtails to wear.</p>

    <p>4. When Chinamen fight they pull each other about by the
    pigtail. Sometimes a schoolmaster punishes bad boys with his
    pigtail.</p>

    <p>5. Rich women are very proud of their tiny feet. Chinese
    ladies can wear shoes about four inches long. Fancy mother
    wearing a doll's shoes!</p>

    <div class="figure2l">
        <img src="illustrations/Fig21-2ed.png"
             width="325"
             height="400"
             alt="">
    </div>

    <p>6. Girls have their feet bound up tightly when they are five
    years of age. The bandages are made tighter every week, until
    the foot stops growing. Of course, the poor girls suffer very
    much. The Chinese have a saying: "Every pair of bound feet
    costs a bath of tears."</p>

    <p>7. When the girls grow up they cannot walk. They can only
    totter along, and they have to lean on the arm of a maid to
    keep themselves from falling.</p>

    <div class="figure2r">
        <img src="illustrations/Fig21-3ed.png"
             width="275"
             height="406"
             alt="">
    </div>

    <p>8. I am glad to say that many parents do not now bind the
    feet of their girls. They have learnt that it is both wicked
    and foolish to do so. At one school in China all the girls have
    their feet unbound. They skip and play about almost as well as
    Kate and May.</p>

    <p>9. You and I think that only dirty, untidy people let their
    nails grow long. Rich people in China never cut their nails.
    They let them grow so long that they have to wear shields to
    keep them from being broken.</p>

    <p>10. The dress of a Chinaman is very simple. He wears
    trousers and several cotton or silk tunics. The outside tunic
    has very long, wide sleeves; these are used as pockets.</p>

    <p>11. The trousers are loose, and are covered up to the knee
    by white stockings. When a Chinaman is in full dress he wears a
    long gown. The Chinese boy wears the same kind of clothes as
    his father. Every man, woman, and child carries a fan.</p>

    <div class="figure2l">

             alt="">
    </div>

    <p>12. Chinese boots are made of cloth or satin, never of
    leather. The soles are made of rags or paper. We blacken the
    uppers of our boots. Chinamen whiten the soles of theirs.</p>

    <p>13. Now I must end this letter. When I come home you must
    ask me to tell you about the rice fields and the silk farms and
    the Great Wall. I have a hundred more things to tell you about
    this wonderful land.&mdash;Your loving

    <h2><a href="#L22">22.&nbsp;&nbsp;A LETTER FROM JAPAN.</a></h2>

    <p>1. MY DEAR CHILDREN,&mdash;Once more I have made a long sea
    voyage, and once more I am safely on shore. I am now in
    Japan.</p>

    <p>2. The Japs live on islands, just as we do. They are brave
    and clever and busy, and they have many fine warships. Because
    of all these things they are sometimes called the Britons of
    the Far East.</p>

    <p>3. Most of the people in the East are very backward. They
    have stood still while the people of the West have gone
    forward. Not so the Japs. They have learnt everything that the
    West can teach them. You will see in Japan all the things on
    which we pride ourselves.</p>

    <p>4. The Japs are first-rate sailors. Some of their captains
    learnt to be sailors on board our warships. They are also fine
    soldiers. You know that not many years ago they beat the
    Russians both by land and by sea.</p>

    <p>5. I like the Japs better than any other people that I have
    met in the East. Many of them still wear the dress of olden
    days, and keep to their simple and pretty ways. Their country
    is beautiful, and they love beautiful things.</p>

    <p>6. They are very fond indeed of flowers, which they grow
    very well. Their gardens are lovely. When the flowers are in
    bloom the Japs troop in thousands to see them. It is pretty to
    watch the delight of fathers and mothers and children at the
    form, colour, and scent of the flowers.</p>

    <p>7. The Japs are very clever workmen. I have often stood and
    watched them at work. They always try to beat their own best.
    Good work of any kind gives them joy; bad work gives them
    pain.</p>

    <p>8. I have bought Jap fans for Kate and May. On these fans
    there are pictures of a snow-clad mountain shaped like a sugar
    loaf. There is no more beautiful mountain in all the world.</p>

    <div class="figure2r">
        <img src="illustrations/Fig22-1ed.png"
             width="500"
             height="226"
             alt="">
    </div>

    <p>9. This mountain began as a hole in the ground. Melted rocks
    boiled up out of the hole and built up the mountain. In time
    the rocks grew cool and hard. Some Japs believe that it was
    formed in a single night!</p>

    <p>10. Steam still comes out of a crack in the side of the
    mountain. This shows that any day melted rocks may boil forth
    again. About two hundred years ago the mountain threw out so
    much ash that it covered a town sixty miles away.</p>

    <p>11. Sometimes the earth shakes and opens in great cracks.
    When the earth "quakes" houses tumble down, and the tops of
    tall trees snap off. Very often lives are
          lost.</p><a name="c23"></a>

    <p>1. When a Jap boy is born there is great joy in his home.
    His mother's friends all come to see him. They bring him
    presents, such as toys, dried fish, and eggs.</p>

    <p>2. Very early in his life the little Jap baby is strapped on
    to his sister's back. He goes with her wherever she goes. If
    the weather is cold, the little girl covers him with her coat.
    When the sun is hot she shelters him with her sunshade.</p>

    <p>3. When she plays she jumps and skips and runs about, and
    all the time baby's little head jerks to and fro. He does not
    mind; he is quite happy. You never hear a Jap baby cry.</p>

    <p>4. When a boy is about three years of age he learns to walk.
    He soon finds his feet, and runs about on high wooden
    clogs.</p>

    <p>5. Jap boys are fond of pets and games. Wherever a boy goes
    he carries with him a long pole. With this he makes flying
    leaps and does many clever tricks.</p>

    <p>6. Every boy in Japan wishes to be either a soldier or a
    sailor when he grows up. Even tiny little mites play with flags
    and drums and little guns. When the boys are older they are
    taught to be brave, and to die if need be for their
    country.</p>

    <p>7. The great day of the year for Jap boys is the fifth day
    of the fifth month. On this day the Feast of Flags is held.
    Over each house where there is a boy you see big paper fish
    floating in the air.</p>

    <p class="pic">8. The shops are then full of toys. Most of the
    toys are soldiers, and sometimes they are like the soldiers of
    olden days. Some are on foot, and some are on horseback; some
    are generals, and some are drummers.</p><a name=

    <p>9. The boys love to play at war. You can always make Jap
    boys happy by giving them a toy army to play with.</p>

    <p>10. The greatest day of the year for the girls is the Feast
    of Dolls. On this day the girls give doll parties to their
    little friends. All the dolls, however old, are brought out and
    dressed up in fine new clothes. The Feast of Dolls is a time of
    great fun and laughter.</p>

    <p>11. Jap children now play many of our games. They are very
    fond of "prisoner's base," "fox and geese," and "tag." The boys
    love kite-flying.</p>

    <div class="figure2r"

             alt="">
    </div>

    <p>12. Sometimes they put glass on the strings of their kites,
    and with it try to cut the strings of other boys' kites. They
    are very clever at this game, and there is great laughter when
    a string is cut.</p>

    <p>13. In the house, during the day, girls like to blow soap
    bubbles. At dusk they are fond of hunting fire-flies, and
    driving them to and fro with fans.</p>

    <p>14. In the summer they catch grasshoppers, and keep them in
    small bamboo cages. They say that the chirping of the
    grasshoppers brings them good luck.</p>

    <p>15. All Japs are polite&mdash;even boys. When a boy goes to
    the house of a friend he squats on his heels. Then he places
    his hands on the floor, and bows until his forehead touches his
    toes. This he does again and again, and all the time he speaks
    very politely.</p>

    <p>16. Jap children are taught to be very kind and helpful to
    their elders, and to the poor and the weak. Yesterday I saw a
    little girl run from her mother to take the hand of a blind man
    and lead him across the street.</p>

    <p>17. Now, my dears, I must end this letter. To-morrow I start
    on my homeward way. I shall sail across the ocean to the great
    land of America. I hope you are all well, good, and happy. Your

    <h2><a href="#L24">24.&nbsp;&nbsp;A LETTER FROM
    CANADA.</a></h2>

    <p>1. MY DEAR CHILDREN,&mdash;Look at the globe in my room and
    find Japan. Then find America. You will see that a broad ocean
    lies between them. It is called the Pacific Ocean. I have
    crossed this ocean, and I am now in the great country of
    Canada.</p>

    </div>

    <p>2. I am sure that you cannot guess where I am writing this
    letter. I am writing it in the train. I have already been three
    days in the train, and I am only half-way across Canada.</p>

    <p>3. I am glad to say that I am once more under the Union
    Jack. The whole land of Canada is British, from sea to sea. Our
    flag floats above every city.</p>

    <p>4. The first part of my journey pleased me most. The train
    ran through a beautiful country, filled with splendid trees.
    Some of them are as high as a church tower, and have trunks
    many yards round. There are no finer trees in all the
    world.</p>

    <p>5. Later in the day our train ran by the side of a rushing
    river, which was deep down in a narrow valley between the
    mountains.</p>

    <p>6. In this river there are millions of salmon. I saw men
    catching them. You will see tins of salmon from this river in
    most of the grocers' shops at home.</p>

    <p>7. As the train ran on, the mountains rose higher and
    higher, until their tops were covered with snow. We then began
    to cross the great Rocky Mountains. Up and up the train
    climbed, until the rails reached their highest point.</p>

    <p class="pic">8. Then we began to descend. We ran through dark
    clefts in the rocks, along the edges of steep cliffs, across
    rivers, and by the side of lakes. High above us were the snowy
    mountain tops. It was all very grand and very beautiful.</p>

        permission of the C.P.R. Co.</i>)</p>
    </div>

    <p>9. At last we left the mountains behind us and reached the
    plains. We are now speeding over these plains. The country is
    as flat as the palm of your hand. Here and there, far apart, I
    can see farm-houses. On these plains the best wheat in the
    world is grown.</p>

    <p>10. In winter the whole land is covered deep with snow, and
    the rivers are frozen over. In April winter gives place to
    spring. Then the snow melts, and the ice on the rivers breaks
    up.</p>

    <p>11. No sooner has the snow gone than the wheat begins to
    spring up. The wheat grows very fast and ripens very quickly.
    Much of it is sent to Britain. Very likely the loaf which you
    ate for breakfast this morning was made of wheat which grew on
    the plains of Canada.</p>

    <p>12. In other parts of Canada there are forests which cover
    thousands of miles of country. The trees in these forests are
    cut down, and are made into planks which are sent to all parts
    of the world.</p>

    <p>13. The trees are felled during winter. Their trunks are
    piled up by the side of a river. When the thaw comes they are
    thrown into the water. Men follow them and push them back into
    the water if they drift ashore.</p>

    <p>1. MY DEAR CHILDREN,&mdash;I am staying for a few days with
    a friend who has a farm on the plains. His house is five miles
    from the railway.</p>

    <p>2. My friend met me at the station with a motor car, and
    drove me over rough roads between huge fields. There are no
    hedges in this part of the country. The fields are divided from
    each other by fences.</p>

    <p>3. This farm is much larger than any farm which you have
    seen in England. The house is built of wood. All round it is a
    pretty garden. Not far away are the stables and the barns.</p>

    <p>4. I am sure you would like to hear something about the
    farmer's children. There are three of them&mdash;a girl and two
    boys. The girl is the youngest, and she is about eight years of
    age.</p>

    <p>5. All the children make themselves very useful in the
    house. Servants are hard to get in Canada, so people must learn
    to help themselves. The boys clean the boots and chop wood. The
    girls think nothing of helping to scrub the floors.</p>

    <div class="figure2r">
        <img src="illustrations/Fig25-2ed.png"
             width="400"
             height="326"
             alt="">
    </div>

    <p>6. After breakfast the children trudge off to school, which
    is three miles away. They take their lunch with them. When they
    return in the evening they have many odd jobs to do.</p>

    <p>7. In the playground of their school you will see many young
    trees growing. There are very few trees on the plains, and far
    more are needed.</p>

    <p>8. On one day in each year the children make holiday, and
    plant trees in the school grounds. The teacher tells them that
    when they grow up they must plant trees on their farms.</p>

    <p>9. Harvest is the busiest time of the year. Then the
    children rise at half-past four, and work all day long in the
    fields. Every one who can work at all must do so at harvest
    time.</p>

    <p>10. There is also plenty of work to be done in the autumn.
    Everything needed in the house must be brought in before the
    snow begins to fall.</p>

    <p class="pic">11. Winter is the real holiday time. No work can
    then be done on the land. The rivers and lakes are frozen, and
    everywhere there is plenty of skating. The wheels are taken off
    the carriages, and runners are put on instead. Horses draw them
    very swiftly over the frozen snow.</p><a name="Photo25-1"></a>

        <p class="caption">BOYS OF CANADA IN WINTER.</p>
    </div>

    <p>12. Look at the picture post-card which I send you with this
    letter. It shows you how Canadian boys are dressed in winter.
    On the ground you see a pair of snow-shoes. The boys can travel
    very quickly on these snow-shoes without sinking into the
    snow.</p>

    <p>13. In the picture you also see a toboggan. It is a small
    sledge. The boy drags his toboggan up to the top of a hill. He
    seats himself on it and pushes off. Away he goes over the
    frozen snow like an arrow from a bow. It is splendid fun.</p>

    <p>14. Those boys and girls whose homes are in towns live very
    much as you do. They go to school, and they play in the streets
    and parks. When summer comes many of them go to the seaside or
    to the lakeside for a holiday.</p>

    <p>15. Sometimes a whole family goes camping in the woods. They
    then live in tents or in little huts by the side of a river or
    a lake. What happy times the children have! They go fishing,
    they bathe, and they dart to and fro in canoes.</p>

    <p>16. Most of the young folks of Canada are strong and
    healthy. They are happy and bright, and they are not afraid of
    work. No children are more useful to their parents than the
    boys and girls of Canada.</p><a name="c26"></a>

        permission of the C.P.R. Co.</i>)</p>
    </div>

    <p>1. Tom will not forgive me unless I tell you something about
    the Red men of America. He has often asked me about the picture
    of Red men which is in my room at home.</p>

    <div class="figure2r"
         style="clear: left;">
        <img src="illustrations/Fig26-1ed.png"
             width="375"
             height="453"
             alt="">
    </div>

    <p>2. In the old days, before white men settled in America, the
    Red men were masters of the land. They were tall and strong,
    and their skin was of a dark copper colour. Their eyes were jet
    black, and their hair was long and straight.</p>

    <p>3. They wore very little clothing, even though the winters
    in North America are very cold. From the time when they were
    babies they were trained to bear heat and cold, hunger, thirst,
    and pain without grumbling.</p>

    <p>4. When the white men landed in America, the villages of the
    Red men were to be found all over the country. Each of these
    villages was the home of a tribe. The houses were tents made of
    skin or huts made of wood.</p>

    <p>5. The women or squaws did all the hard work. They planted
    and tilled the fields, cooked the food, and made the clothes.
    The babies were put into little bark cradles, which were
    sometimes hung from the branches of trees, and were rocked to
    and fro by the wind.</p>

    <p>6. The Red men were nearly always at war, either amongst
    themselves or against the white men. In battle they were very
    crafty and skilful. Those who fell into their hands were
    sometimes treated very cruelly.</p>

    <p>7. Before the Red men went on the "warpath" they painted
    their faces, so as to frighten their foes. Then they took up
    their bows and hatchets, and, following their leader, strode
    silently away.</p>

    <p>8. The Red men did not care to fight in the open. They
    always tried to catch their foes asleep or to take them by
    surprise.</p>

    <div class="figure2l">
        <img src="illustrations/Fig26-2ed.png"

             alt="">
    </div>

    <p>9. In those days the land was full of deer and other wild
    animals. On the great plains where the wheat now grows huge
    herds of bison used to feed.</p>

    <p>10. The Red men hunted the bison on their swift little
    ponies. When they were close to the animals they shot at them
    with arrows. If the arrows missed their mark, the Red men
    killed the bison with their knives.</p>

    <p>11. When the white men came they hunted the bison with guns,
    and soon killed them off. Only a few bisons remain, and these
    are now kept in parks.</p>

    <p>12. There are not many Red men left in North America. Most
    of them have died off. Many of those who now remain have given
    up their old way of living.</p><a name="c27"></a>

        <p class="caption">Amongst the Eskimos.</p>
    </div>

    <p>1. Here is another picture for you. Look at it carefully. It
    shows you the people who live in the far north of Canada. They
    are called Eskimos.</p>

    <p>2. In the upper part of the picture you see a man on a
    sledge. He is dressed in furs, and has fur gloves on his hands.
    His head and ears are covered with a hood. In the far north of
    Canada the cold is so bitter in winter that men's hands and
    ears would be frost-bitten if they were not kept warm in this
    way.</p>

    <p>3. In winter the sea and the land are thickly frozen over.
    The whole country is covered with ice and snow. The Eskimo has
    to travel over the ice to get from place to place. He uses a
    sledge drawn by dogs. There is a team of dogs in the upper part
    of the picture.</p>

    <p>4. Sometimes the sledge is overturned, and the men and dogs
    are thrown into deep, wide cracks in the ice. Sometimes fierce
    storms arise, and men and dogs perish together. Sometimes food
    runs short, and they die of hunger.</p>

    <p>5. In the middle part of the picture you see a tent. The
    Eskimos can only live in tents during the short summers; during
    the long dark winters they live in huts. The walls are made of
    stones and sods. The roof is of wood which has drifted to their
    shores. You must remember that no trees will grow in these very
    cold lands.</p>

    <p>6. Some Eskimos make their winter houses of blocks of snow,
    with sheets of ice for the windows. Perhaps you shiver at the
    thought of living in a snow house, but you need not do so.</p>

    <div class="figure2r">

             height="239"
             alt="">
    </div>

    <p>7. Really, a snow house is quite a snug home. The snow keeps
    in the heat of the house, just as a blanket keeps in the heat
    of your body. Perhaps you know that it is the blanket of snow
    spread over the ground in winter which keeps the roots of the
    plants from being frozen.</p>

    <p>8. When summer comes, the snow and ice melt along the edge
    of the sea. Then the Eskimo leaves his winter quarters for the
    seashore.</p>

    <p>9. The sea-shores of these very cold lands abound in bears,
    seals, foxes, and other wild animals. The sea is full of fish,
    and millions of gulls, geese, and other birds fly north for the
    summer.</p>

    <div class="figure2l">

    </div>

    <p>10. When a boy is ten years of age his father gives him a
    bow and arrows and a canoe. Then he thinks himself a man
    indeed. In the lower part of the picture you see a man in an
    Eskimo canoe. He is going to hunt seals and small whales.</p>

    <p>11. Now I must bring this long letter to a close. I shall
    write you one more before I start for home. I am eager to see
    you all again.&mdash;Your loving FATHER.</p><a name="c28"></a>

    <h2><a href="#L28">28.&nbsp;&nbsp;FATHER'S LAST
    LETTER.</a></h2>

    <p>1. MY DEAR CHILDREN,&mdash;This is the last letter which I
    shall write to you from abroad. I hope to sail for home in a
    week's time. I shall send you a telegram to tell you when I
    shall arrive. You must all come to the station to meet me.</p>

    <p>2. Look at the globe and find North America. The northern
    half is called Canada, and the southern half is called the
    United States. I am now in New York, the largest city of the
    United States.</p>

    <p>3. The people of the United States speak English. The
    forefathers of many of them came from our islands. But the
    United States do not belong to Britain. Their flag is not the
    Union Jack, but the Stars and Stripes.</p>

    <p>4. This morning at breakfast a black man waited upon me. His
    skin was very dark, his lips were thick, and his hair was short
    and curly.</p>

    <p>5. Are you not surprised to hear that there are black men in
    America? There are thousands of them in New York. In the
    southern part of the United States there are more black men
    than white men.</p>

    <p>6. Most of the black men live in the hot part of the United
    States, where cotton and sugar are grown. White people cannot
    work in the cotton or sugar fields, because the sun is too hot
    for them.</p>

    <p>7. The black people who live in the United States were born
    in America. They have never known any other land. America,
    however, is not their real home. They really belong to
    Africa.</p>

    <p>8. How is it that we now find them in America? When the
    white men of America began to grow cotton and sugar, they
    needed black men to work in the fields. Men called "slavers"
    went to Africa in ships. They landed and pushed inland. When
    they came to villages they seized the people and drove them off
    to the ships.</p>

    <p>9. The poor blacks, who were thus dragged from their home
    and kindred, were thrust into the holds of ships and carried to
    America. Sometimes they suffered much on the voyage. The
    weakest of them died, and were thrown overboard.</p>

    <p>10. When they reached America they were sold to the
    cotton-growers and sugar-growers, who carried them off to work
    in the fields. Sometimes they were kindly treated; sometimes
    they were flogged to make them work. But whether kindly or
    cruelly treated, they were no longer men and women, but
    slaves.</p>

    <p>11. This went on for many years. At last some kind-hearted
    men in the northern states said, "It is wicked to own slaves.
    All the slaves in America shall be set free."</p>

    <div class="figure1r"

    </div>

    <p>12. The farmers of the south were very angry when they heard
    this, and said that they would not free their slaves. Then a
    fierce war broke out. The North beat the South, and when the
    war came to an end all the slaves in America were set free.</p>

    <p>13. The blacks still work in the cotton and sugar and
    tobacco fields; but they now work for wages, just as I do. They
    are free to come and go as they please.</p>

    <p>14. The darkies are very merry and full of fun. When their
    work is over they love to sing and dance to the music of the
    banjo. Some of their songs are very pretty. I will sing some of
    them to you when I come home. Good-bye, dears. I shall soon be

    she said. "The house must be made beautiful for father's
    return."</p>

    <p>3. May and I worked with mother, but the day passed very
    slowly. Father's train was to arrive at six o'clock. By
    half-past five we were all at the station waiting for him.</p>

    <p>4. At last the train steamed in, and out jumped father. Oh,
    how we hugged and kissed him! Father was well, and he looked
    very brown.</p>

    <p>5. I sat next to him in the cab. He told us that his ship
    had only reached Liverpool that morning. He had taken the first
    train for home, because he wished to see us so much.</p>

    <p>6. After tea he opened one of his boxes. "I have brought
    each of you a present," he said. "Sit down, and I will show you
    some pretty things."</p>

    <p>7. Mother's present was a dress from India. It had gold and
    beetles' wings on it. They were a lovely shiny green, just like
    jewels.</p>

    <p>8. My present was a necklace of beautiful blue stones. May's
    was a dolly, dressed just like an Indian lady. Tom's was a kite
    from Japan. It was shaped just like a dragon. Of course, we
    were all delighted with our gifts.</p>

    <p>9. Then father told us many things about his travels. "I
    have been right round the world," he said. "I sailed to the
    East, and I went on and on until I returned to the place from
    which I set out."</p>

    <p>"I know," cried Tom. "I have followed you all round the
    world on the globe."</p>

    <p>10. May was sitting on father's knee. "Dad," she said, "I
    suppose you are the very first man who has ever been right
    round the world." "Of course he is," said Tom.</p>

    <p>11. Father laughed. "No, my dear," he replied; "thousands of
    men had been round the world before I was born."</p>

    <p>12. "I'm so sorry," said May. "I did so want to tell the
    girls at school that my father was the very first man who ever
    went round the world."</p><a name="Exercises"></a>

    round the earth at the Equator is 25,000 miles. A railway
    train, running 50 miles an hour, and never stopping, would
    require nearly three weeks for the journey. Find out whether

    half this distance and mark it on the globe. Then mark the same
    distance on the other side of the Equator. The points which you
    have marked are called the <i>Poles</i>. One is the <i>North
    Pole</i>; the other is the <i>South Pole</i>.</p>

    parts. Each of these parts is called an ocean. There are five
    oceans</i>&mdash;<i>Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, Arctic, and

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689

An alternative method of locating eBooks:
